##A Quick Sprint Through What I've Learnt So Far##

=======================================================

This is a repo just for personal reflection. It will likely not get taken to completion.

I will attempt to recreate what i've created so far in the 'boris-bikes' repo from memory a few times.

This is just to help me engrain the TDD/BDD process, in an OOP project. And start to get myself to the point where its hardcoded in my mind.

If you wish to contribute, 'boris-bikes' will be the actual project repo to look at.

However if you have comments or advice on what you see here, please feel welcome to leave a comment!

The user stories provided as a basis for this project are as below:

  As a maintainer of the system,
  So that members of the public can get usable bikes,

Thanks for reading,
